My name is Myungjun Kim. I am a Master course student in Seoul National University majoring in Statistics. I graduated Korea University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. I've had interests in Statistical Learning and its applications. I will post with the relevant topics. Hope my works will help someone.
